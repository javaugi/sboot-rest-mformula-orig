Automating Lighthouse audits within your CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipeline is an excellent way to ensure your web 
    applications consistently meet performance, accessibility (WCAG/ADA), best practices, and SEO standards. By integrating these checks, 
    you can catch issues early in the development cycle, before they reach production.

Here's a breakdown of how to achieve this, focusing on WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)
    compliance through Lighthouse's accessibility audits.

Why Automate Lighthouse in CI/CD?
    Early Detection: Catch accessibility and performance regressions as soon as they are introduced.
    Consistency: Ensure all code changes are automatically evaluated against defined standards.
    Developer Feedback: Provide immediate feedback to developers, making it easier to fix issues.
    Compliance: Help maintain adherence to accessibility standards like WCAG, which is crucial for ADA compliance.
    Efficiency: Reduce manual testing efforts and integrate quality checks seamlessly into the development workflow.

Tools and Concepts
    Lighthouse CI: This is the official Google tool for running Lighthouse programmatically and integrating it into CI/CD. It allows you to set performance budgets, track changes over time, and fail builds if certain thresholds aren't met.
    CI/CD Platform: (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, CircleCI, Azure DevOps) â€“ Where your automation scripts will run.
    Docker (Optional but Recommended): For consistent environments across different CI/CD runners.
    Reporting: Lighthouse CI can generate various reports (HTML, JSON) and upload them to a server or store them as build artifacts.

Steps to Automate Lighthouse Audits for Accessibility
Step 1: Set up a Test Environment
    Your CI/CD pipeline needs a way to run your application. This could be:
    Deploying a temporary staging environment: The most robust approach, as it tests the full deployment process.
    Running a local server: If your application can be built and served locally within the CI environment.
    Ensure your application is accessible via a URL that Lighthouse CI can reach.

Step 2: Install Lighthouse CI
    In your project, install Lighthouse CI as a development dependency:

    npm install @lhci/cli --save-dev

Step 3: Configure Lighthouse CI (.lighthouserc.js)
    Create a configuration file (e.g., .lighthouserc.js at the root of your project) to define how Lighthouse should run and what thresholds to enforce.

module.exports = {
  ci: {
    collect: {
      // URL(s) to audit. This should be the URL of your deployed or locally served app.
      url: ['http://localhost:3000'], // Or your staging URL
      // Number of times to run Lighthouse for each URL
      numberOfRuns: 3,
      // Optional: Set a static asset server if running locally
      // staticDistDir: './build', // For React apps, assuming 'build' is your production output
    },
    assert: {
      // Define assertions for different categories.
      // Lighthouse scores are 0-100. Set a minimum acceptable score.
      assertions: {
        'accessibility:': ['error', { minScore: 90 }], // Fail if accessibility score is below 90
        'best-practices:': ['warn', { minScore: 80 }],  // Warn if best practices score is below 80
        'performance:': ['warn', { minScore: 70 }],    // Warn if performance score is below 70
        'seo:': ['warn', { minScore: 90 }],            // Warn if SEO score is below 90
        // You can also assert specific audit results:
        // 'aria-allowed-attr': 'off', // Turn off a specific audit if it's not relevant or you handle it differently
        // 'color-contrast': ['error', { minScore: 0.9 }], // Example for a specific audit
      },
    },
    upload: {
      // Optional: Upload results to Lighthouse CI server or a custom storage
      // target: 'lhci', // default
      // serverBaseUrl: 'http://localhost:8080', // URL of your LHCI server
      // token: 'YOUR_LHCI_TOKEN', // LHCI server upload token
      // Or save as artifacts in your CI/CD system
      target: 'filesystem',
      outputDir: './.lighthouseci',
    },
  },
};

Key for WCAG/ADA Compliance: The accessibility: assertion is paramount here. Lighthouse's accessibility audits are based on WCAG 2.x standards, 
    and passing these audits helps significantly with ADA compliance.

Step 4: Integrate into your CI/CD Pipeline
This step varies depending on your CI/CD platform. Here's a general example using GitHub Actions:

.github/workflows/lighthouse-audit.yml

name: Lighthouse CI Audit

on: [pull_request, push] # Run on pull requests and pushes to main branch

jobs:
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Or your project's Node.js version

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build application (if not already built)
        run: npm run build # Assuming your build command is 'npm run build'

      - name: Start server
        run: npm start & # Or a command to serve your build output
        # If your build output needs a static server, you might use:
        # run: npx serve build &
        # wait-on: 'http://localhost:3000' # Wait for the server to be ready

      - name: Run Lighthouse CI
        run: npx @lhci/cli autorun
        env:
          # If you're uploading to an LHCI server, uncomment and set this
          # LHCI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.LHCI_TOKEN }}

      - name: Upload Lighthouse reports
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: lighthouse-reports
          path: ./.lighthouseci

Explanation of CI/CD Steps:
    Checkout Code: Gets your project's code.
    Set up Node.js: Ensures the correct Node.js environment.
    Install Dependencies: Installs project dependencies, including @lhci/cli.
    Build Application: Creates the production-ready build of your React app. Lighthouse should audit the production build, not the development server.
    Start Server: A crucial step. Lighthouse CI needs a running web server to audit. This could be:
        A simple static server for your build directory (e.g., npx serve build &).
        Your actual Spring Boot backend if it serves the React frontend.
        A temporary deployment to a staging environment.
        The & puts the server in the background. wait-on (a separate npm package) is useful to ensure the server is fully up before Lighthouse runs.
    Run Lighthouse CI: Executes the autorun command, which uses your .lighthouserc.js configuration.
    Upload Reports: Saves the generated Lighthouse reports as CI/CD artifacts, so you can download and review them later.

Step 5: Review Results and Act
    CI/CD Output: Your pipeline will show whether the Lighthouse audit passed or failed based on your assertions.
    Artifacts: Download the .lighthouseci artifacts to view the detailed HTML reports. These reports provide specific recommendations 
        and details for each audit, helping you understand why an accessibility score might be low and how to fix it.
    Iterate: Use the feedback to improve your code. For accessibility, focus on issues like:
        Missing alt text for images.
        Insufficient color contrast.
        Missing form labels.
        Incorrect ARIA attributes.
        Keyboard navigability issues.

Advanced Considerations
    Lighthouse CI Server: For tracking trends over time, comparing results across branches, and centralizing reports, consider setting up a dedicated Lighthouse CI server.
    Custom Audits: For very specific WCAG requirements not fully covered by Lighthouse's default audits, you might need to write custom Lighthouse audits or integrate other accessibility testing tools (e.g., axe-core).
    Authentication: If your application requires authentication, Lighthouse CI can be configured to log in before running audits (e.g., using collect.settings.extraHeaders or collect.settings.emulatedUserAgent).
    Performance Budgets: Beyond accessibility, use Lighthouse CI to enforce performance budgets (e.g., maximum JavaScript bundle size, first contentful paint time).
    Mobile vs. Desktop: Configure Lighthouse CI to run audits for both mobile and desktop viewports to ensure responsiveness and accessibility across devices.

By implementing these steps, you can establish a robust system for continuously monitoring and improving the accessibility and overall quality of your React applications directly within your CI/CD workflow.
