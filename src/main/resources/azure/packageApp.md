Short opening (one-paragraph summary)

For the Medicaid application assessment and approval system I built, I would package each Spring Boot microservice into a multi-stage Docker image, 
    externalize configuration into Spring profiles and Kubernetes resources (ConfigMaps/Secrets or Key Vault), and deploy to AKS using Helm charts
    with environment-specific values.yaml. Production-grade optimizations include minimal build images, JVM tuning, resource requests/limits, 
    liveness/readiness probes, autoscaling (HPA and KEDA for Event Hub load), connection pooling for Cosmos DB, caching reference data in Redis, 
    structured logging with PII scrubbing, and strong security via Managed Identities and private endpoints to satisfy HIPAA compliance.

1) Containerization — practical steps & sample Dockerfile
    Use a multi-stage build to keep images small and reproducible.
    Dockerfile (multi-stage, JDK build + JRE runtime):
2) Managing multiple config profiles (dev/staging/prod)
    Spring profile strategy
    Keep application.yml for defaults and application-dev.yml, application-staging.yml, application-prod.yml for overrides.
    Externalize sensitive values (DB keys, Event Hub connection strings) to Azure Key Vault (or k8s secrets) — do not store in image.
    On Kubernetes / Helm
    Use values-dev.yaml, values-staging.yaml, values-prod.yaml.

Map environment via Helm values:
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: dev for dev charts.
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: prod for prod.
    Secure secrets
    Use Azure Key Vault + CSI Secrets Store driver to mount secrets or use Managed Identity to fetch at runtime.
    Alternatively use sealed-secrets or external secret operator.

3) Helm chart structure & example snippets
    templates/deployment.yaml (snippet)
    values-prod.yaml (important parts)
4) CI/CD integration (build, push, helm deploy)
    GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps steps (high level):
        Build & test: mvn -DskipTests=false test package
        Build Docker image & scan: docker build, trivy scan
        Push to ACR with immutable tag (git SHA / semver)
        Update Helm values (image.tag = $SHA) and run helm upgrade --install medicaid-app ./charts -f values-prod.yaml --set image.tag=$SHA
        Run post-deploy smoke tests and promote images between environments (dev → staging → prod) using pipeline approvals.
    Notes:
        Use image immutability (no latest in prod).
        Use Helm releases and rollback on failed health checks.
5) Key production optimizations & considerations
    a) JVM & container optimizations
        Set JAVA_OPTS per environment: -Xms, -Xmx matched to container memory (avoid OOM). Example:
        -Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap (modern JDKs handle cgroup),
        Use class-data sharing (CDS) or JLINK for smaller startup in latency-sensitive services if appropriate.
        Enable -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError for diagnostics.
    b) Resource requests/limits & HPA/KEDA
        Set requests close to expected steady usage and limits slightly higher to handle bursts.
        HPA on CPU / custom Prometheus metrics (e.g., events.lag) for HTTP APIs.
        For streaming consumers (Event Hub), use KEDA to scale on EventHub/ServiceBus metrics or custom lag.
    c) Health checks & graceful shutdown
        Implement /actuator/health/readiness to include DB/Cosmos connectivity, cache readiness, Event Hub checkpoint store accessibility.
        Liveness should be lightweight (process alive).
        Respect SIGTERM to stop consuming new events, finish processing and checkpoint, then exit.
    d) Database & connection tuning (Cosmos DB)
        Use singleton CosmosClient with Direct (TCP) mode and preferred regions.
        Tune connection pool and max connections.
        Use bulk operations and transactional batch for same-partition writes during spikes.
        Cache reference data (Redis) to reduce RU and latency.
        Monitor RU consumption and add backpressure / fallback (blob/queue) if throttled.
    e) Logging / security & HIPAA concerns
        Structured JSON logs with correlationId (MDC) and redact or avoid logging PII (SSN, DOB); use tokenization or hashing.
        Integrate with Azure Monitor / Log Analytics or EFK stack.
        Use Managed Identity to access Cosmos/KeyVault/Storage — no secrets in repo.
        Use private endpoints and VNET integration for Cosmos/KeyVault/Redis.
        Encryption at rest & in transit; audit logs enabled.
    f) Network & Pod security
        Implement NetworkPolicys to restrict traffic between pods.
        Limit container capabilities and use non-root user.
        RBAC for Kubernetes resources and limited ServicePrincipal roles.
    g) Observability and SLOs
        Expose metrics via Micrometer to Prometheus, and traces to Application Insights / OpenTelemetry collector.
        Create dashboards: processing latency histogram, event lag, RU usage, error rates.
        Configure alerts for: consumer lag > threshold, 429 throttling, increased error rate, memory OOM.
    h) Cost & performance tradeoffs
        Autoscale RU on Cosmos for spikes or use bulk buffering to blob + async backfill.
        Use TTL on historical items if retention required; separate hot vs cold containers.
6) Deployment strategies & rollbacks
    Use Helm release with readiness checks — Kubernetes will not switch traffic until readiness passes.
    For schema migrations (DB): use Liquibase with careful roll-forward + backward-safe changes. Prefer additive schema changes first.
    For risky changes or high traffic, use canary / blue-green deploys (Helm + traffic manager / ingress rules) to gradually shift traffic.
    Use automated rollback on failed liveness/readiness post-deploy.

8) Example CI stage for Helm deploy (GitHub Actions snippet)
    - name: Helm Deploy to AKS
      env:
        KUBECONFIG: ${{ secrets.KUBE_CONFIG }}
      run: |
        helm repo add mycharts https://mychartrepo
        helm upgrade --install medicaid-app ./charts/medicaid-app \
           -f charts/medicaid-app/values-prod.yaml \
           --set image.tag=${{ env.IMAGE_TAG }}
9) Final considerations (operational / compliance)
    For Medicaid app: ensure audit logs, data access controls, retention policies, and PII minimization are enforced end-to-end.
    Perform load testing (spike & soak) to validate autoscaling, RU consumption, and backup replay flows.
    Have runbooks for throttling, rebuild/replay (changefeed), and incident response.
    Closing sentence (tie to your experience)

When I did the Medicaid automated assessment system, I followed this same pattern — multi-stage images, Azure Key Vault for secrets, Helm for
    environment-specific deployments, readiness & liveness checks that gated traffic only when DB and Event Hub checkpoints were healthy, and
    KEDA-driven autoscaling to gracefully handle peak surges. I also built runbooks for throttling and replay, and ensured PII handling met 
    compliance by redacting logs and using managed identities and private endpoints throughout.
