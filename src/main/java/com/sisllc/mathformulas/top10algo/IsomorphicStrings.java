    /*
    To check if two strings are isomorphic, it means determining if a one-to-one mapping exists between the characters of the two strings. 
        In other words, each character in the first string must map to a unique character in the second string, and vice-versa, while 
        maintaining the order of characters.    
    
    Key points:
        Same Length: Isomorphic strings must have the same length. If the lengths differ, they cannot be isomorphic.
        One-to-One Mapping: Each character in the first string must map to a unique character in the second string. No two characters 
            in the first string can map to the same character in the second string.
        Order Preservation: The order of characters must be maintained during the mapping.
        Self-Mapping: A character can map to itself.
    Example:
        "egg" and "add" are isomorphic because 'e' can map to 'a', and 'g' can map to 'd'.
        "foo" and "bar" are not isomorphic because 'o' in "foo" would need to map to both 'a' and 'r' in "bar," violating the one-to-one mapping rule.
        "paper" and "title" are isomorphic because 'p' maps to 't', 'a' maps to 'i', 'e' maps to 'l', and 'r' maps to 'e'.
    In Summary: Isomorphic strings must have the same length, but having the same length is not enough to conclude that two strings are isomorphic.
        The key is the existence of a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the two strings while preserving the order.
