OTA-Specific Questions
Q: How would you ensure the security of OTA updates?

Sample Answer:
"Security is paramount for OTA. I'd implement:
    Code signing - All update packages cryptographically signed
    End-to-end encryption - TLS for transmission, encrypted storage
    Authentication - Mutual TLS for vehicle-server communication
    Authorization - Role-based access for update initiation
    Audit logging - Immutable logs of all update operations
    Rate limiting - Prevent DDoS attacks on update servers"

Q: How would you handle rollback scenarios when an update fails?

Sample Answer:
"I'd design a multi-stage approach:
    Client-side verification - Checksum validation before installation
    Staged rollout - Update small vehicle groups first
    Health checks - Post-update diagnostics from vehicles
    Automated rollback - If failure rates exceed thresholds
    Version compatibility - Ensure rollback versions are safe
    Status tracking - Clear records of which vehicles rolled back
The database would track all these states to enable precise targeting of fixes."
