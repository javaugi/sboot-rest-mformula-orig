Q: How would you design an API for update campaign management?

Sample Answer:
"I'd create a comprehensive API with:
    Campaign creation with parameters (target vehicles, rollout schedule)
    Campaign modification (pausing, adjusting scope)
    Status monitoring endpoints
    Webhook support for event notifications
    Bulk operations for fleet-wide updates

The design would use:
    DTOs for clear input/output contracts
    Validation annotations
    Pagination for large result sets
    ETags for optimistic concurrency control
    Comprehensive documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI"
