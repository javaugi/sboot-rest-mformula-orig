    Client software in vehicles
    Communication protocols
    Security mechanisms
    Database for tracking update statuses
Key Challenges:
    Handling millions of vehicles
    Differential updates to minimize bandwidth
    Rollback mechanisms for failed updates
    Security and authentication
    Update prioritization and scheduling
