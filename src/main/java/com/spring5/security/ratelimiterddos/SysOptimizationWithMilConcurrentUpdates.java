Scenario-Based Questions
Q: How would you optimize the system when 1 million vehicles all request updates simultaneously?

Sample Answer:
"I'd implement several strategies:
    Queue Management: Prioritize critical updates and stagger others
    CDN Distribution: Serve update packages via geographically distributed CDNs
    Differential Updates: Only send changed portions of software
    Rate Limiting: Implement smart throttling at the API gateway
    Horizontal Scaling: Auto-scale backend services in cloud environment
    Caching: Cache frequent requests at multiple levels
    Asynchronous Processing: Use message queues for non-critical operations"
