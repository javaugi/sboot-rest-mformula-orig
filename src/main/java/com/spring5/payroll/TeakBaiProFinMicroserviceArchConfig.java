1. Microservices Strategy
A. Service Decomposition

Microservice        Responsibility                                  Tech Stack
Timekeeping         Track employee hours, shifts, PTO               Spring Boot + Kafka (events)
Billing             Generate client invoices (hourly/fixed-fee)     Spring Boot + MongoDB
Payroll             Calculate salaries, taxes, deductions           Spring Boot + Rules Engine (Drools)
Financial Reporting GL, P&L, tax filings                            Spring Boot + PostgreSQL
    Notifications       Alerts for payroll runs, invoice due dates      Spring Cloud Stream + Twilio
API Gateway         Route requests, handle auth                     Spring Cloud Gateway

5. Example Workflow
    Timekeeping Service
    Employee submits timesheet → TimesheetApprovedEvent published to Kafka.
    Billing Service (Listens to event)
    Generates invoice using BillingStrategy (hourly/project-based).
    Payroll Service
    Runs payroll using TaxCalculator (region-specific rules).
    Financial Service
    Updates GL entries via CQRS pattern.

6. Key Java Libraries
    Spring Boot:                Microservices framework.
    Spring Cloud:               Service discovery (Eureka), Config Server.
    Lombok:                     Reduce boilerplate code.
    MapStruct:                  DTO conversions.
    JUnit 5 + Testcontainers:   Integration testing.

Summary
Challenge                       Solution                            Pattern/Tech
Regional payroll rules          Strategy + Drools rules engine      Decoupled business logic
Distributed transactions	Saga pattern + Kafka                Event-driven consistency
Complex billing                 Decorator + Facade                  Flexible pricing models
High-volume payroll             CQRS + Spring Batch                 Scalable reads/writes
Audit compliance                Event sourcing + ELK                Immutable transaction history

This architecture ensures modularity, scalability, and regulatory compliance while leveraging Java’s strengths. 
    Start with bounded contexts (DDD) and incrementally decompose into microservices.
