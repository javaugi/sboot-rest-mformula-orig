DeepSeek Chat (including DeepSeek-V3) can process Word (.docx) and PDF documents. You can upload these files, and I'll read and analyze
    the text content to answer your questions or summarize the information.

Supported Document Formats:
✅ PDF (text-based, not scanned images)
✅ Word (.docx)
✅ TXT (plain text files)
✅ Excel (.xlsx, .xls) (can read tables and data)
✅ PowerPoint (.pptx) (extracts text from slides)

Limitations:
❌ Scanned PDFs/images (if text isn't selectable, I can't read it)
❌ Handwritten documents (requires OCR, which I don't support yet)
❌ Password-protected/encrypted files

After processing a Word, PDF, or other document, DeepSeek Chat can provide the extracted or analyzed information in several practical output formats, depending on your needs. Here are the common ways you can use the output:

1. Text-Based Output (Directly in Chat)
    Summaries – Concise overviews of the document.
    Key Points – Bullet lists of important information.
    Answers to Questions – Responses based on the document's content.
    Extracted Data – Tables, figures, or structured data from the file.
2. Exportable Formats
    Since DeepSeek Chat currently does not support direct file downloads, you can manually copy and paste the processed text into:
    New Word (.docx) or TXT file – For reports or further editing.
    Excel (.xlsx) – If data is in tabular form.
    PowerPoint (.pptx) – For slide-based summaries.
3. Structured Formats (If Needed)
You can request the output in:
    JSON or CSV (for data-heavy documents).
    Markdown (.md) – For well-formatted notes.
    HTML – If you need web-compatible formatting.
4. Special Use Cases
    Code Extraction – If the document contains code, I can output it in syntax-highlighted blocks.
    Translation – Convert extracted text into another language.
    Reformatted Content – Change style (e.g., formal to casual).
