/*
To create immutable objects with Lombok's @Builder, you need to combine it with other Lombok annotations and follow specific practices. Here's how:
    1. Use @Value or @Getter with final fields:
        @Value: This annotation makes all fields private and final by default, and it does not generate setters. It also generates constructors, equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods.
        @Getter with final fields: If you need more control over constructor generation, use @Getter and declare all fields as final.
    2. Apply @Builder:
        `Add the @Builder annotation to your class. This will generate a builder class and a builder() method for creating instances of your class.

        /*
    Choosing the right approach:
            If you need to modify multiple fields at once, the @Builder approach with toBuilder() is generally more flexible.
            If you only need to modify a single field, @Value with @With can be a simpler alternative. 
        Both approaches provide efficient ways to create copies of immutable objects while maintaining immutability
