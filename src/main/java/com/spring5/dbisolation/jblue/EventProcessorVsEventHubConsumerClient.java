/*
 * This is a much more common and important comparison. The choice between
 * EventProcessorClient and EventHubConsumerClient is about the pattern of consumption,
 * not generations of SDKs. Both are part of the modern azure-messaging-eventhubs SDK.
 * 
 * Here’s the clear breakdown.
 * 
 * /* The Quick Comparison Aspect EventProcessorClient EventHubConsumerClient Primary Use
 * Case Continuous, high-throughput, fault-tolerant processing Directed, on-demand, or
 * manual reads from specific partitions Pattern
 * "I want to process all events from all partitions, forever."
 * "I want to read some events from a specific partition, right now." Parallelism
 * Automatic. Manages multiple partitions concurrently. Manual. You manage reading from
 * each partition. Checkpointing Built-in, automatic. Uses a CheckpointStore (e.g., Azure
 * Blob). Manual. You must manage your own offset/sequence number tracking. Fault
 * Tolerance High. Automatically recovers and load balances. None. It's a simple client;
 * your application logic must handle failures. Complexity Simpler application logic. The
 * SDK handles the complex orchestration. More complex application logic. Y
 * 
 * 
 * 1. EventHubConsumerClient (The "Manual" Tool) Use the EventHubConsumerClient when you
 * need precise, direct control over reading from a specific partition. It does not manage
 * parallelism, checkpointing, or failover for you.
 * 
 * When to use it: Replaying events from a specific point in time in a specific partition.
 * Auditing or debugging by manually inspecting events in a partition. Building a simple
 * consumer for a single-partition Event Hub. Any scenario where your consumption is
 * episodic or on-demand, not continuous. How it works: You ask for events from a specific
 * partition and starting position (e.g., EventPosition.earliest(),
 * EventPosition.latest(), or from a specific sequence number). Code Example: Manual
 * Consumption with EventHubConsumerClient
 * 
 * 
 * 2. EventProcessorClient (The "Orchestrated" Tool) Use the EventProcessorClient when you
 * need a robust, continuous, and scalable service to process events from all partitions
 * of an Event Hub. It handles the complexity for you. When to use it: The primary use
 * case for most production applications. Building a background service that constantly
 * processes an event stream. Processing events from multiple partitions in parallel.
 * Needing automatic checkpointing and fault tolerance (if a node dies, another picks up
 * its work). Code Example: Robust Processing with EventProcessorClientExample
 * 
 * 
 * Summary and Decision Tree Use EventProcessorClient if: You are building a service that
 * needs to run continuously. You need to process events from all partitions. You want
 * automatic load balancing and fault tolerance. You want automatic checkpointing to
 * persist your progress. (This covers 95% of production use cases)
 * 
 * Use EventHubConsumerClient if: You are writing a simple script or admin tool. You need
 * to read from a specific, known partition. You need to read a specific, finite set of
 * events (e.g., replay history). You want complete, low-level control over the read
 * operation.
 * 
 * Interview Answer: "The choice depends on the consumption pattern. The
 * EventProcessorClient is for building robust, continuous background services. It
 * automatically manages reading from all partitions, checkpointing progress to a durable
 * store like Azure Blob, and recovering from failures—this is what I'd use for most
 * production microservices.
 * 
 * "The EventHubConsumerClient is a simpler, more direct client. I'd use it for
 * administrative tasks, like manually reading events from a specific partition for
 * debugging, or for building a simple tool that doesn't need the full fault-tolerant
 * orchestration provided by the EventProcessorClient. In short, EventProcessorClient for
 * scalable services, EventHubConsumerClient for directed reads and tools."
