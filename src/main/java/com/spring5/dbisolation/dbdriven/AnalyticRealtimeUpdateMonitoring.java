Question: How would you implement a real-time dashboard for OTA update progress?

-- Materialized view for dashboard
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ota_dashboard AS
SELECT
    od.deployment_id,
    od.deployment_name,
    od.status AS deployment_status,
    sp.package_version,
    COUNT(vu.update_id) FILTER (WHERE vu.status = 'success') AS completed,
    COUNT(vu.update_id) FILTER (WHERE vu.status IN ('downloading', 'installing')) AS in_progress,
    COUNT(vu.update_id) FILTER (WHERE vu.status = 'failed') AS failed,
    COUNT(vu.update_id) FILTER (WHERE vu.status = 'pending') AS pending,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(vu.update_id) FILTER (WHERE vu.status = 'success') / 
        NULLIF(COUNT(vu.update_id), 0), 2) AS completion_rate,
    MIN(vu.attempt_time) AS first_attempt,
    MAX(vu.completion_time) AS last_completion
FROM ota_deployments od
JOIN software_packages sp ON od.package_id = sp.package_id
LEFT JOIN vehicle_updates vu ON od.deployment_id = vu.deployment_id
GROUP BY od.deployment_id, od.deployment_name, od.status, sp.package_version
WITH DATA;

-- Refresh function with pg_cron
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_ota_dashboard()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY ota_dashboard;
    RETURN NULL;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Trigger for updates
CREATE TRIGGER refresh_dashboard_trigger
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON vehicle_updates
FOR EACH STATEMENT EXECUTE FUNCTION refresh_ota_dashboard();

-- Time-series view for progress tracking
CREATE VIEW deployment_progress AS
SELECT
    deployment_id,
    date_trunc('hour', attempt_time) AS hour_bucket,
    status,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM vehicle_updates
GROUP BY deployment_id, hour_bucket, status;
